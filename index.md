## Hey There!

This is just a small Brainwriting Blog to write about everything I learned and want to share.

I´m studying Computer Science at a German University and I´m especially interested in Game Development, Bioinformatics and much more.

Here, i´m planning to write a bit about some of my projects, my learnings and some other stuff I feel interested in.
